# Crypto-currency-price-Forcasting
Data-Driven Software for crypto price predicting where I have merged these two datasets where I will be applying LR(Linear Regression), DNN(deep neural network), RNN-LSTM or other neural networks using keras to predict the high price of the day with which anyone who wanted to trade will be able to buy coin on the low price and then sell it on the next high price. This will help in managing the risk assesment with respect to how much I need to invest accordingly and also maintaining portfolio.
